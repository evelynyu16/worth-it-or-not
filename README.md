Note:

Because Render free tier does not persist disk storage,
uploaded images may be deleted after redeploy or restart.

The system automatically detects missing images and displays a fallback image instead.

# Project Overview

Worth It or Not is a full-stack web application that helps students make smarter purchasing decisions by learning from real purchase reflections shared by other students.

Students often purchase items based on online hype, recommendations, or assumptions, and later realize the product was not as useful as expected. This app makes those “expectation vs. reality” experiences easy to browse, filter, and contribute.

This application allows students to:

- Browse real student purchase reflections  
- Compare expectation vs. reality  
- Share their own experiences  
- Upload images of purchased items (optional)  
- Edit uploaded images (replace or remove existing images)
- Track their personal purchase history (My Posts Only + Profile page)  
- Edit and delete their own posts using an iOS-style edit modal  
- Paginate through large datasets (better UX for many posts)

The system supports both:

1. Pre-purchase decision support  
2. Post-purchase reflection and tracking

# User Stories

## User Story 1 — Browse Posts (with Pagination)

As a student,  
I want to browse purchase reflections,  
So that I can learn from others’ experiences.

Implementation:

- API: `GET /api/posts`
- Page: Home
- Includes:
  - Pagination (page / pageSize)
  - Refresh button to reload
  - Click a post card to open a detail modal

## User Story 2 — Submit Purchase Reflection (with Image Upload)

As a student,  
I want to submit my purchase experience,  
So that I can share whether an item was worth it.

Implementation:

- API:  
  - `POST /api/posts`  
  - `POST /api/upload`
- Page: Submit
- Includes:
  - Optional image upload + preview
  - Client-side validation

## User Story 3 — View Personal Purchase History

As a student,  
I want to view my own posts,  
So that I can track my purchase history.

Implementation:

- API: `GET /api/posts?profileId=<id>`
- Page: Home + Profile
- Includes:
  - Profile page to save a nickname (profileId stored in localStorage)
  - Home page “My posts only” checkbox uses that profileId

## User Story 4 — Filter Posts by Category (Case-insensitive)

As a student,  
I want to filter posts by category,  
So that I can focus on relevant items.

Implementation:

- API: `GET /api/posts?category=Tech`
- Page: Home
- Notes:
  - Category filter supports case-insensitive matching (e.g., `tech` works)

## User Story 5 — Edit/Delete My Own Posts (with Image Editing)

As a student,  
I want to edit or delete my own posts,  
So that I can correct or update my reflections.

Implementation:

- API:
  - `PUT /api/posts/:id`
  - `DELETE /api/posts/:id`
  - `POST /api/upload`
- Page: Home
- Includes:
  - iOS-style edit modal
  - Edit text fields
  - Replace image
  - Remove image
  - Preview image before saving
  - Edit/Delete buttons only appear for posts created under the current profileId
